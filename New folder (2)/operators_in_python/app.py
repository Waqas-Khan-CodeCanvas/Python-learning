# Operators in Python are special symbols that perform operations on variables and values. Python provides several types of operators:

# 1. Arithmetic Operators

# a = 10
# b = 5

# print("a + b = ", a + b)  #Addition
# print("a - b = ", a - b)    #	Subtraction
# print("a * b = ", a * b)    #	Multiplication
# print("a / b = ", a / b)    #    Division
# print("a % b = ", a % b)    #    Modulus
# print("a // b = ", a // b)  #    Floor Division
# print("a ** b = ", a ** b)  #    Exponentiation


# 2 Comparison (Relational) Operators
# Used to compare values and return True or False.

# a = 10
# b = 5

# print("a > b is", a > b)  # Greater than
# print("a < b is", a < b)  # Less than
# print("a == b is", a == b)  # Equal to
# print("a != b is", a != b)  # Not equal to
# print("a >= b is", a >= b)  # Greater than or equal to
# print("a <= b is", a <= b)  # Less than or equal to

# 3. Logical Operators
# Used to combine conditional statements.

# a = True
# b = False

# print("a and b is", a and b)  # Logical AND
# print("a or b is", a or b)  # Logical OR    
# print("not b is", not b)  # Logical NOT

# logical in operator on relational operators
# a = 10
# b = 5

# print("a > b and a == b is", a > b and a == b)  # Logical AND
# print("a > b or a == b is", a > b or a == b)  # Logical OR
# print("not a > b is", not a > b)  # Logical NOT

# . Assignment Operators
# Used to assign values to variables.
# a = 10
# b = 5

# print( "a = ", a)
# print( "b = ", b)
# a=a+b
# a+=b
# print("a += b is", a)  # Add AND

# a -= b
# print("a -= b is", a)  # Subtract AND

# a *= b
# print("a *= b is", a)  # Multiply AND
# print(a)

# a /= b
# print("a /= b is", a)  # Divide AND

# a %= b
# print("a %= b is", a)  # Modulus AND

# a //= b
# print("a //= b is", a)  # Floor Division AND

# a **= b
# print("a **= b is", a)  # Exponentiation AND


# Identity Operators
# Used to compare memory locations of two objects.
#  is 
# is not

# a = 10
# b = "10"
# print("a is a is", a is a)  # True if both variables are the
# print("a is not b is", a is not b)  # True if both variables are not the same object

# Membership Operators
# Used to test if a sequence is presented in an object.
# in
# not in

text = "Hello world"

print("H" in text)  # True if "H" is present in the string
print("h" not in text)  # True if "h" is not present in the string
